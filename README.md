This project is a Real-Time Device Tracker built using Socket.IO for efficient and instantaneous communication. The web application allows users to track devices in real-time, visualizing their location and status updates as they happen.

Features:
Real-time updates: Leverages Socket.IO for instant, bidirectional communication between the server and connected clients.
Live tracking: Devices are tracked continuously, with updates pushed to the UI in real-time.
Scalable: Efficient socket-based architecture that can handle multiple devices simultaneously.
User-friendly interface: Clean and simple UI for visualizing tracked devices on a map or dashboard.
Tech Stack:
Backend: Node.js, Express, Socket.IO
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with real-time data rendering)
